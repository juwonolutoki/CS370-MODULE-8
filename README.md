# CS370-MODULE-8
# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
We were provided with some starter code and a sample environment where the pirate agent will be placed. I had to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train my pirate agent. I Completed the code for the Q-Training Algorithm section in your Jupyter Notebook. In order to successfully complete the code, I did the following:
Developed a code that meets the given specifications below. 
Complete the program for the intelligent agent so that it achieves its goal: The pirate should get the treasure.
Apply a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are problem-solvers and innovators. They design algorithms, build software, optimize systems, and ensure that technological solutions meet the needs of users and organizations. Their work extends across various domains such as artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, data science, and software engineering, influencing industries like healthcare, finance, entertainment, and education. The work of computer scientists matters because it directly impacts how people live, work, and communicate. For example: In healthcare, they develop technologies like electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices. In finance, they create secure transaction systems, fraud detection algorithms, and stock trading platforms. In entertainment, they build gaming technology.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist typically involves several key steps:
Understanding the problem: The first step is to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. You need to understand the requirements and constraints clearly before jumping into solutions.
Research and knowledge gathering: Drawing from previous work, established algorithms, and existing solutions helps form a solid foundation for addressing the problem.
Design and planning: Computer scientists often design a high-level solution before diving into the technical details. This may involve creating algorithms, choosing the right programming languages or frameworks, and planning the architecture of the solution.
Implementation: Writing code to solve the problem, making sure to follow best practices for readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
Testing and debugging: Testing ensures that the solution works as expected, and debugging is essential for fixing errors and improving performance.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities are paramount. The technologies you create can have profound effects on individuals and society. Ethical responbilities includes: Privacy and security: Protecting the privacy of users and securing their data should be a priority. Computer scientists must design systems that guard against unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse. Transparency and accountability: End users should have a clear understanding of how technology works, especially in areas like AI and machine learning, where systems might make decisions that affect people's lives (e.g., hiring decisions or medical diagnoses).
